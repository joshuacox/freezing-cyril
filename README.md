DebianScripts
=============

This is a ragtag collection of misfit debian tasks that got turned into one-liners which got stuck in files and are in various states of development, anything worthwhile will be removed and given its own repo, so expect things to go wrong.  Pull requests welcome!
just added sprunge script to make more use of this amazing cli utility (that is a website)
bl script works in most places I have tested it, let me know if anyone finds it not working on their system
clean docker scripts will remove all layers
kill docker scripts will kill all docker containers
self-signed cert generators for octohost

Beware there be dragons!

just no lynchburg lemons
